  <p>In this paper, we will describe the current state of some of the tagging of articles within the
      <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">PMC Open Access subset</a>. As a
    case study, we will use our experiences developing the <a
      href="https://github.com/erlehmann/open-access-media-importer">Open Access Media Importer</a>,
    a tool to harvest content from the OA subset for automated upload to <a
      href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Open_Access_Media_Importer"
      >Wikimedia Commons</a>.</p>
  <p>Tagging inconsistencies stretch across several aspects of the articles, ranging from licensing
    to keywords to the media types of supplementary materials. While all of these complicate
    large-scale reuse, the unclear licensing statements had the greatest impact, requiring us to
    implement text mining-like algorithms in order to accurately determine whether or not specific
    content was compatible with reuse on Wikimedia Commons.</p>
  <p>Besides presenting examples of incorrectly tagged XML from a range of publishers, we will also
    explore past and current efforts towards standardization of license tagging, and we will
    describe a set of recommendations related to tagging practices of certain data, to ensure that
    it is both compatible with existing standards, and consistent and machine-readable.</p>
  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
  <h2 id="scope-of-this-paper">Scope of this paper</h2>
  <p>The aim of this paper is to describe the problems that we came across when attempting to reuse
    materials from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">PMC Open Access
      Subset</a> in an automated fashion and at scale. Some of the issues are specific to certain
    kinds of content, others are a barrier to reuse more generally. Some of them are specific to
    individual articles, journals or publishers, while others apply more widely.</p>
  <p>In discussing these issues, we take the perspective of a re-user of JATS-conveyed content,
    conscious of the possibility that the perspectives of producers and curators of this content and
    of maintainers of JATS standards may differ. We conclude with a series of recommendations that
    would have facilitated the implementation of our reuse project and that could serve as the basis
    for a discussion on how to facilitate reuse more generally.</p>
  <h2 id="the-open-access-media-importer">The Open Access Media Importer</h2>
  <p>The <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Open_Access_Media_Importer_Bot">Open Access
      Media Importer</a> is an automated bot, developed with <a
      href="https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing/Wissenswert_2011"
      >initial support</a> from <a href="http://www.wikimedia.de/wiki/Hauptseite">Wikimedia
      Deutschland</a>, that harvests multimedia content from open access repositories, and uploads
    that content to <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/">Wikimedia Commons</a>, the media
    repository used by the Wikipedias and their sister project. Once in Wikimedia Commons, those
    multimedia files are very easy to insert into Wikipedia pages, and to be reused on a wide
    variety of other wikis and Wikimedia projects.</p>
  <p>Currently, the OAMI harvests content from the PMC Open Access Subset. Since most articles in
    the subset are actually not Open Access (in the sense of being free to reuse, revise, remix and
    redistribute), the bot scans the XML sources of new articles and reads the license information
    in order to determine those that are. It then checks whether these have multimedia files in
    their supplementary materials. If so, they are downloaded, converted and uploaded to Wikimedia
    Commons along with the available metadata. At the time of writing, <a
      href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Open_Access_Media_Importer"
      >over 13,000 multimedia files</a> had been processed this way. Figure 1 illustrates the
    timeline of uploads per day from the OAMI to Wikimedia Commons, from its inception up to the
    present time.</p>

  <h1 id="license-tagging">License tagging</h1>
  <p>As mentioned above, an important function of the OAMI is to determine, for each media file, the
    license under which it or its parent article has been released.</p>
  <p>In reading and analyzing the license data, the OAMI looks for licenses that are truly open, in
    the sense of being free to reuse, revise, remix and redistribute, as laid out in the <a
      href="http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read">Budapest Open Access Initiative</a> a
    decade ago. Licenses with &quot;non-commercial&quot; and &quot;no derivatives&quot; clauses are
      <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing">not acceptable</a> on Wikimedia
    Commons. Figure 2 shows a breakdown of the licenses we have found in the PMC OA subset for
    articles indexed during the first week of May this year, with color-coding to illustrate which
    licenses are &quot;free&quot; in the sense of allowing reuse on Wikimedia Commons, and which are
    not. More formal definitions of this sense of freedom can be found in the <a
      href="http://freedomdefined.org/">Definition of Free Cultural Works</a> and the <a
      href="http://opendefinition.org/">Open Definition</a>.</p>

  <p>This information is tagged in the source XML for each article. In the rest of this section, we
    will review the JATS elements and attributes related to license data, and then describe some of
    the problems we encountered when trying to harvest this data from actual articles.</p>
  <p>In JATS 1.0, there are several XML elements and attributes that are used to specify license
    information for an article and its accompanying multimedia files.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=permissions"
        >&lt;permissions&gt;</a> - this is a container element, within which all copyright and
      license metadata should appear</li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license"
          >&lt;license&gt;</a> - this is the main element for specifying license information. Among
        the attributes allowed on this element, the following are relevant:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=license-type"
            >@license-type</a> - the value is not constrained; &quot;open-access&quot; is one
          suggested value.</li>
        <li><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=xlink:href"
            >@xlink:href</a> - takes an external URL; often the URL identifying the specific
          Creative Commons license.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license-p"
          >&lt;license-p&gt;</a> - paragraph of text within a &lt;license&gt; element. Semantically,
        this is a <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=p">&lt;p&gt;</a>
        element with the addition of <a
          href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=price">&lt;price&gt;</a> to
        the content model. (Prior to the NLM Tag Set version 3.0, the &lt;p&gt; element was used
        here.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=ext-link"
          >&lt;ext-link&gt;</a> - can appear within the &lt;license-p&gt; element, and provides a
        link to an external resource. This also takes an optional <code>xlink:href</code>
        attribute.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>An example of good license tagging, from the <a
      href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license">JATS 1.0 Tag Library
      documentation</a>, is the following.</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;permissions&gt;</span>
  ...
  <span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;license-p&gt;</span>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the
      Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use,
      distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original
      work is properly cited.<span class="kw">&lt;/license-p&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/permissions&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>In the above example, the Creative Commons license is unambiguously identified by the URI in
    the @xlink:href attribute of the &lt;license&gt; element. The &lt;license-p&gt; element provides
    the human-readable text of the license, which matches the machine-readable version (except for
    not including the version number of the Creative Commons license, and the hyperlink.)</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>PMC Tagging Guidelines and Style Checker</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>PMC provides additional recommendations and specifications for article tagging, which are
    layered on top of the requirements of the JATS standard. These are documented at the <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/style.html">PMC
      Tagging Guidelines</a>, and they include guidelines for tagging <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-license"
      >license information</a>.</p>
  <p>Recently, in part in order to minimize some of the inconsistencies in tagging that are
    described below, PMC has amended these to include the following statement:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When including a URI for a license, the URI should be included either on the &lt;license&gt;
      in @xlink:href (preferred) or in an &lt;ext-link&gt; in the content of the license. The URI
      must not be tagged in both places.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Complementing that, the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/stylechecker/">Style
      Checker</a> now has additional checks to help ensure the consistency of the license
    information. In particular, it will generate an error if there is an <code>xlink:href</code>
    attribute on the &lt;license&gt; element, and one on a descendent &lt;ext-link&gt; element, and
    the URIs do not match.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, these recent changes do little to address most of the problems described in this
    paper. We provide some recommendations for how these resources could be further improved, in the
      <em>Recommendations</em> section, below.</p>
  <h2 id="problems-encountered-by-the-bot">Problems encountered by the bot</h2>
  <p>While developing and deploying the OAMI, we discovered that automatically discerning the
    licensing terms and reuse rights was non-trivial.  In contrast to the example of
    &quot;good&quot; markup above, within the article XML available from the PMC OA subset,
    licensing metadata is not expressed consistently across journals, and sometimes not even across
    different articles of the same journal.  Here, we list a few examples.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Contradictory information</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>In many cases, the URI identifying the Creative Commons license was contradicted by the
    human-readable text.  For example, from the article <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC2658715"
      >PMC2658715</a> (<a
      href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05520.x/abstract">publisher
      version</a>), the URI specifies &quot;CC-BY&quot;, but the human-readable description adds the
    extra &quot;NC&quot; (non-commercial) restriction:</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span> 
<span class="ot">         xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;</span>Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Creative Commons Deed, 
    Attribution 2.5, which does not permit commercial exploitation.<span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>In other examples, the human-readable descriptions were actually self-contradictory. The
    following is an example from <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3143982"
      >PMC3143982</a> that also has a typo in the license name.</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license-p&gt;</span>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attr0ibution 3.0 License 
    (by-nc 3.0).<span class="kw">&lt;/license-p&gt;</span>
  ...
<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>We have found that the phenomenon of self-contradictory licenses is rather common and not
    restricted to small and lesser known publishers. The next example is from <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3468739/"
      >PMC3468739</a>. While the machine-readable license is CC BY, the human-readable version has a
    non-commercial clause.</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span> 
<span class="ot">         xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license-p&gt;</span>Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Creative 
    Commons Deed, Attribution 2.5, which does not permit commercial 
    exploitation.<span class="kw">&lt;/license-p&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>License information outside the &lt;license&gt; element</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>In the following example, from <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3158088/"
      >PMC3158088</a>, the Creative Commons license text is given in the &lt;copyright-statement&gt;
    element rather than the &lt;license&gt; element.</p>

  <span class="kw">&lt;copyright-year&gt;</span>2011<span class="kw">&lt;/copyright-year&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/permissions&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>These statements in the &lt;copyright-statement&gt; element may (<a

      >PMC3589467</a>) contain an <code>xlink:href</code> attribute, even within otherwise identical
    license text.</p>
  <p>At the time of this writing, PMC has <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22author+manuscript%22%5Bfilter%5D">281,148
      author manuscripts</a>, of which <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22author+manuscript%22%5Bfilter%5D+AND+%22open+access%22%5Bfilter%5D"
      >5383</a> (about 2%) are in the OA subset. In a sample of those that are not in the OA subset,
    it was found that 1%, do in fact have a Creative Commons license, but the license information is
    completely outside of the &lt;permissions&gt; element. For example, in <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3143982PMC3717328/"
      >PMC3717328</a>, the license information is given in a &lt;fn&gt; element within the back
    matter:</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;fn</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;FN5&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;p</span><span class="ot"> content-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;publisher-disclaimer&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;bold&gt;</span>Open Access<span class="kw">&lt;/bold&gt;</span>: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative
    Commons Attribution License 3.0 which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in
    any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited. To view a copy of
    the license, visit <span class="kw">&lt;ext-link</span><span class="ot"> ext-link-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;uri&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">      xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;</span>
    <span class="kw">&gt;</span>http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/<span class="kw">&lt;/ext-link&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/fn&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>This effectively makes it undiscoverable, because any automatic process attempting to determine
    the license of an article would have to exclude things outside of the &lt;permissions&gt;
    element, otherwise there would be the possibility of false positives resulting from articles
    that <em>discuss</em> and <em>quote</em> licenses and license text within the article body.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Contradictory URIs</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Until recently, many articles in PMC had mismatches between the URIs that appear on the
    &lt;license&gt; element and those that appear inside the license text within &lt;ext-link&gt;
    elements. To address this problem, as mentioned above, PMC has instituted a new Style Checker
    rule that requires that if there are multiple URIs, they must match.</p>
  <p>In addition, PMC has fixed most instances of such conflicts within the existing database.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>No machine-readable URI</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Some articles (including the vast majority of those deposited by PLOS) have Creative Commons
    licenses, but don't contain any machine-readable URI identifying that license. An example of the
    tagging from a recent PLOS ONE article, <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3738584/"
      >PMC3738584</a>, is:</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;permissions&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;copyright-year&gt;</span>2013<span class="kw">&lt;/copyright-year&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;copyright-holder&gt;</span>Bassaneze et al<span class="kw">&lt;/copyright-holder&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;license-p&gt;</span>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the 
      Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, 
      distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author 
      and source are credited.<span class="kw">&lt;/license-p&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/permissions&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>This is particularly troubling, since PLOS papers represent a large and quickly increasing
    percentage of PMC, and especially PMC's OA content. Additionally, the phrasing of the
    human-readable text may vary across articles from the same journal that are under the same
    license.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Missing license information altogether</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Finally, there are the cases of articles in the OA subset (e.g. <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3775889/"
      >PMC3775889</a>) that have no license information in the XML at all, meaning that an automated
    tool would either have to consider the article to be under &quot;all rights reserved&quot; –
    which would even prohibit the kind of data mining that the OA subset is intended for and that
    the OAMI performs – or to contain code specific to particular journals or publishers, or require
    manual assistance by a human (who, in the case of the cited example, would find out that the
    article in question is <a href="http://currents.plos.org/genomictests/terms-of-use/">actually
      licensed CC BY</a>).</p>
  <h2 id="impact-of-these-problems-on-pmc">Impact of these problems on PMC</h2>
  <p>PMC recently implemented a search-by-license feature, described on their <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/">Open Access Subset</a> page. This
    feature allows users to query for articles matching specific Creative Commons licenses, and can
    be combined with other search terms.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, because of the tagging problems described above, the PMC indexer, in many cases,
    cannot correctly determine the license of articles. Therefore, the search result sets are much
    smaller than they otherwise would be.</p>
  <p>For example, in a sample of 100 articles that are in the OA subset, but that do not match the
    &quot;cc license&quot; filter (<a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22open+access%22%5Bfilter%5D+NOT+%22cc+license%22%5Bfilter%5D"
      >PMC search</a>), it was found that 99 did, in fact, have CC licenses, but that tagging
    problems prevented them from being correctly identified as such. At the time of this writing,
    there were 663,843 articles in the OA subset, and 52% did not match the &quot;cc license&quot;
    filter. If the sample described above is representative, then that means about 340,000 eligible
    articles would not be discoverable through this search feature.</p>
  <h2 id="impact-of-these-problems-beyond-pmc">Impact of these problems beyond PMC</h2>
  <p>In the OAMI, these problems necessitated the development of a fairly sophisticated text-mining
    module that examined both the machine-readable URI in the &lt;license&gt; element, as well as
    the human-readable expressions, so as to determine the publisher's intent. Because of Wikimedia
    Commons' strict enforcement of proper licensing, it was important that this module be
    conservative:  false positives being much less acceptable than false negatives.</p>
  <p>Development of a license-mining algorithm such as this is costly, and would tax the resources
    of any project seeking to reuse PMC OA content. Even with this algorithm, the inconsistency and
    number of errors that we found indicate that there are still a great number of articles that
    could legitimately be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, but that are not properly identified. This
    does a disservice to those who released their material with reuse-friendly licenses, often in
    the hopes of having it be used as widely as possible.</p>
  <p>The lack of ability to reliably determine licensing information on a per-article basis
    contributes to other problems as well. One such problem is that publishers sometimes erect
    paywalls around open access content, counter to the express wishes of the authors. One way to
    explain this could be that the sites are not flexible enough to handle per-issue or per-article
    license information. Perhaps, if the tagging of this information in JATS XML documents were
    consistent and reliable, it would facilitate systems that were more flexible, and able to serve
    open content directly, which still presenting a paywall for closed content.</p>
  <p>As another example, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) already allows one to <a
      href="http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=byLicense">list journals by license</a>, and plans are
    afoot to expand this functionality to the level of individual articles. Again, this could be
    facilitated by consistent and reliable tagging of JATS XML articles.</p>

      <em>Multiple licenses with different scope</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Recently, some journals have begun to make data and supplementary materials available under a
    license that differs from the main article's license. For example, F1000Research is providing
    articles with text content that is available under CC-BY, but with accompanying data available
    in the public domain (CC0). Here is an example of the tagging of a recent article from their
    website:</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;permissions&gt;</span>

  <p>The scope and the intent of each of the two &lt;license&gt; elements is clear to a human
    reader, but, unfortunately, there is no way for an automated bot to be able to unambiguously
    identify the two different scopes.</p>
  <p>If licensing information were available along with provenance on a per-file basis in a
    machine-readable format, there would be potential for automated checks of licensing information.
    Few scholars outside the field of copyright law are aware of all the implications of publishing
    under certain licenses, which sometimes leads to content available under a particular license
    being published (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=60001"
      >Example 1</a>) or re-published (<a
      href="http://www.plosbiology.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=53679">Example 2</a>) in
    incompatibly licensed papers. In Example 1, the issue could be solved by the copyright holder
    changing the licensing of the original file, whereas in Example 2, a video displaying wrong
    license information was fixed and re-uploaded at the publisher's site but <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485268/bin/pone.0046962.s003.mp4">not at
      PMC</a>, despite the published correction.</p>
  <p>There is no straightforward way to detect such cases algorithmically, and raising awareness for
    these issues amongst authors, editors and reviewers can certainly not be automated either.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Incremental licenses</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Often, articles are published with license terms that change over time. The following is an
    example from <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.cgi?db=pmc&amp;id=3601365"

  <p>One problem with this is that both licenses are given within a single &lt;license&gt; element,
    which would complicate the data model for any program attempting to process these. Another is
    that there is no machine-readable indication of the time period covered by each of the two
    separate licenses.</p>
  <p>We provide a recommendation of how this tagging could be improved (both for licenses with
    different scope, and with different effective date ranges) in &quot;PMC license metadata&quot;,
    below.</p>
  <h2 id="standardization-efforts">Standardization efforts</h2>
  <p>There have been a number of efforts to standardize the expression of license metadata. Among
    these are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://creativecommons.org/ns">Creative Commons Rights Expression Language</a>
      (CC-REL)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.editeur.org/21/ONIX-PL/">ONIX for Publications Licenses</a>
      (ONIX-PL)</li>
    <li>Ongoing <a
        href="http://www.niso.org/news/pr/view?item_key=d2e5f409bc6af6b7f504a10edf0329203ffec6f9"
        >NISO Initiative to Develop Standard for Open Access Metadata and Indicators</a></li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Access/Signalling_OA-ness"
        >Wikipedia: Signalling OA-ness</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Many of these standards provide complex mechanisms for specifying or customizing the particular
    terms of a license. We welcome these efforts, and look forward to the time when the tags they
    define can be integrated with JATS. However, the simplest and most fundamental way of robustly
    signalling a license will probably always be to unambiguously link to a URI that's defined,
    controlled and perhaps versioned by an established organization such as Creative Commons.</p>
  <h1 id="media-types">Media types</h1>
  <p>In addition to the problems with communicating the licensing terms, the media types of
    supplementary materials are frequently not indicated properly, which reduces discoverability and
    translates into extra efforts before any reuse becomes possible.</p>
  <p>Media types (originally called &quot;MIME types&quot;) are two part identifiers that describe
    the format of a multimedia file. Familiar examples are &quot;text/plain&quot;, and
    &quot;application/xml&quot;. When serving these types of files, web servers provide the media
    type in the HTTP &quot;Content-type&quot; header. This allows the client to determine how the
    file should be processed. In the case of the OAMI, the processing is the conversion of the file
    format, since Wikimedia Commons only accepts audio or video files encoded in open formats.</p>
  <p>The JATS standard provides two attributes to allow for encoding the media types of files that
    accompany journal articles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=mimetype">mimetype</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=mime-subtype"
        >mime-subtype</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These attributes are allowed on several elements that identify these types of files, including
      <a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=supplementary-material"
      >&lt;supplementary-material&gt;</a> and <a
      href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=media">&lt;media&gt;</a>.</p>
  <p>The JATS specification includes the following example of how to tag a media file in an
    article's supplementary material (slightly elided):</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;supplementary-material</span><span class="ot"> id=</span><span class="st">&quot;S1&quot;</span><span class="ot"> xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;1471-2105-1-1-s1.pdf&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">                        mimetype=</span><span class="st">&quot;application/pdf&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;caption&gt;</span>
    <span class="kw">&lt;p&gt;</span>Supplementary PDF file supplied by authors.<span class="kw">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;/caption&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/supplementary-material&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>Note:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <code>mimetype</code> attribute is used to store both parts of the media type, rather
      than splitting out the &quot;subtype&quot; into the <code>mime-subtype</code> attribute</li>
    <li>The information about the media file is given right on the &lt;supplementary-material&gt;
      element, rather than, for example, a child &lt;media&gt; element.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In contrast, the <a
      href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/tags.html#el-suppl"
      >PMC Tagging Guidelines</a> stipulate, for the &lt;supplementary-material&gt; element:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Should include &lt;media&gt; or &lt;graphic&gt; to identify the supplemental file. File
      description in &lt;media&gt; or &lt;graphic&gt; must include the file name (including file
      extension) in @xlink:href; &lt;media&gt; also requires @mime-type [sic], and
      @mime-subtype.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, there is some ambiguity as to the best practice for tagging supplementary media files.</p>
  <h2 id="media-type-and-related-problems">Media type and related problems</h2>
  <p>The following are some examples of the problems that we encountered that are related to media
    types.</p>
  <p>Foremost were those resulting from mismatches among:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The declared media type in the @mimetype and @mime-subtype attributes of the source XML,
      including mismatches between the XML available from the publisher and PMC,</li>
    <li>The &quot;Content-type&quot; headers as seen from PMC, and</li>
    <li>The actual media type of the file.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Mismatches between publisher XML, PMC XML, and Content-type</em>

    <strong>
      <em>Missing media type in XML</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Many articles lack any indication of the media type within their XML. For example, in the
    article <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3765204/"
      >PMC3765204</a>, there is no media type indicated for either Movie 1 or Movie 2. The two
    videos in <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3770602/"
      >PMC3770602</a> also lack any indication of media type.</p>
  <p>The problem of missing @mimetype and @mime-subtype attributes is fairly common. For example, in
    the article <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3765681/"
      >PMC3765681</a>, the XML lacks any indication of the media type:</p>

  <span class="kw">&lt;/caption&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/media&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>After September, 2013, when PMC stopped writing these attributes into source XML (see
    &quot;Recent efforts at PMC&quot;, below) the frequency of this problem went up, but the
    frequency of incorrect attribute values went down, as would be expected.</p>

      <em>Problems with &lt;label&gt;, &lt;caption&gt; and &lt;title&gt;</em>

  <p>In addition to problems involving the media types, there is also a lot of variability in the

    problems for automated tools.</p>

      <em>Missing references to supplementary materials</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>In a few cases, the source XML of suitably licensed articles available from PMC do not have any
    reference to the multimedia files whatsoever. For example <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=3104346"
      >PMC3104346</a> has two supplemental videos, which can be viewed <a
      href="http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/59/787/suppl/DC1">on the publisher's
      site</a>, but are not referenced in the XML.</p>
  <p>Another example of this is <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=3423924"
      >PMC3423924</a>, which has a supplemental video that can be downloaded from the <a
      href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijad/2012/914947/sup/">publisher site</a>, but, again,
    no reference to that from the XML.</p>
  <h2 id="recent-efforts-at-pmc">Recent efforts at PMC</h2>
  <p>Many of the problems described above were due to PMC's incorrectly adding @mimetype and
    @mime-subtype attributes to XML that it received, based on the assumption that the media file's
    extension accurately reflects its media type. When it was recognized that the filename extension
    was not a reliable indicator of the media type, and that it's better to have no declared media
    type than to have it wrong, PMC has stopped executing this function.</p>
  <p>Also, in part because of the recognition that the values for @mimetype and @mime-subtype being
    supplied by publishers was not reliable, PMC is in the process of changing the Tagging
    Guidelines to make these attributes, when they appear on the &lt;media&gt; element,
    optional.</p>
  <p>Also, in response to some of these problems, PMC has implemented a new feature in its rendering
    software to ensure the accuracy of the &quot;Content-type&quot; header it provides in response
    to HTTP requests for the media files. This makes use of the standard Unix library <a
      href="http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?libmagic+3+NetBSD-current">libmagic</a>, which is
    also used by the OAMI and determines a file's type based on patterns of data within its content.
    In this way, PMC can be sure that it is delivering accurate metadata in the HTTP response, based
    on the actual file at the time it is served.</p>
  <p>There are no plans to retroactively fix the existing XML markup in the PMC database, or to
    adjust the @mimetype or @mime-subtype attributes for any new articles received.</p>
  <h2 id="standardization-efforts-1">Standardization efforts</h2>
  <p>Over the past few years, the NISO/NFAIS Supplemental Journal Article Materials Working Group
    has been working on standards for handling supplementary materials, and has published <a
      href="http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/rp-15-2013">NISO RP-15-2013, Recommended Practices
      for Online Supplemental Journal Article Materials</a> earlier this year.</p>
  <p>This document lists &quot;recommended minimal and extended metadata&quot; (section B.2.2
    Metadata Elements), and recommends open formats that can be rendered by free, open-source, and
    ubiquitous application software (section B.4.2 Preservation Recommendations) and also briefly
    touches upon licensing (section A.3.10 Rights Management). With respect to media types, the
    group recommends – as part of a strategy to enable long-term preservation – that publishers
    accept supplementary materials in formats defined in formal format registries, such as the <a
      href="http://www.udfr.org/">Unified Digital Format Registry (UDFR)</a> or <a
      href="http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM">PRONOM</a>. These formats provide much more
    information than the simple media type.</p>
  <p>The kind of media type issues reported here would be much less frequent in articles properly
    tagged according to these NISO recommendations.</p>
  <h1 id="keywords">Keywords</h1>
  <p>The OAMI, when it uploads files to Wikimedia Commons, assigns them to Wikimedia Commons
    categories, so as to facilitate search and discovery by users. The OAMI attempts to determine
    these categories based on keywords or subjects in the source XML, or MeSH terms supplied by the
    journal, by PMC or by PubMed for the corresponding article. We found that articles within the OA
    subset had very inconsistent tagging of keywords, and that caused many problems.</p>
  <p>The NISO JATS specification provides recommendations in the <a
      href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/0.4/n-pu72.html">Tagging Keywords</a>
    section of each of the three tag sets. It describe two main methods for tagging keywords:</p>
  <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
    <li>With any of a number of elements inside &lt;kwd-group&gt;: &lt;kwd&gt;,
      &lt;compound-kwd&gt;, &lt;compound-kwd-part&gt;, &lt;nested-kwd&gt;, and
      &lt;unstructured-kwd-group&gt;</li>
    <li>With &lt;subject&gt; elements inside &lt;subj-group&gt;, inside
      &lt;article-categories&gt;</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 id="tagging-with-kwd-family-elements">Tagging with kwd-family elements</h2>
  <p>The &lt;kwd-group&gt; element is a container for other elements that specify the keywords
    themselves. It takes an attribute, @kwd-group-type, that qualifies the type of keywords that
    appear in the group. The JATS specification <a
      href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=kwd-group-type">page for this
      attribute</a> indicates that it should be used for either of two purposes: defining the
    authority of a controlled vocabulary from which the keywords come, or for describing the type of
    the keywords as &quot;hierarchical&quot;, &quot;abbreviation&quot;, etc. (This is an unfortunate
    conflation of two orthogonal concepts.)</p>
  <p>The &lt;kwd-group&gt; element can appear within either article or section metadata.
    Unfortunately, at present, it cannot be applied to individual media or data files. However,
    there is a <a href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/view_comment.php?comment_id=252"
      >comment on the NISO site</a> requesting that this attribute be added to several other
    elements, including &lt;media&gt; and &lt;supplementary-material&gt;, and we support this
    suggestion.</p>
  <p>The following is an example of the typical usage of &lt;kwd-group&gt; and &lt;kwd&gt;, from <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=2630158"

  <h2 id="tagging-with-subject">Tagging with &lt;subject&gt;</h2>
  <p>In many articles, keywords are tagged within &lt;subject&gt; elements, that are nested

  <h2 id="tagging-problems">Tagging problems</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Bad keywords</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Because the values for keywords are unconstrained, and typically not members of a controlled
    vocabulary, there is no way to validate them. This, of course, leads to problems with typos,
    misspellings, differences in case, and so forth, that make them difficult to process by
    machine.</p>
  <p>For example, we have noticed that in PLOS articles, a recurring typographical error is
    encountered, in which a superfluous space is inserted into a keyword. When media files from
    these articles are processed by the OAMI and uploaded to Wikimedia Commons, they are thus
    assigned the Wikimedia Commons category &quot;<a
      href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Biophysic_al_simulations">Biophysic al
      simulations</a>&quot;. To work around this problem, we have inserted a permanent redirect from
    that misspelled category to one with the proper spelling. The presence of files in this
    redirected category then triggers another bot on Wikimedia Commons to fix the categorization of
    affected files automatically.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Inconsistent use of the @subj-group-type attribute</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Most of the time, the &lt;subj-group&gt; and &lt;subject&gt; elements are used to specify, not
    keywords, but a subject heading that would appear in the Table of Contents for a journal issue;
    and is often equivalent to the type of article, as &quot;Article&quot;, &quot;Letter to
    Editor&quot;, &quot;Meeting Notice&quot;, etc. When used this way, the @subj-group-type
    attribute normally has the value &quot;heading&quot;.</p>
  <p>When using &lt;subj-group&gt; and &lt;subject&gt; elements to describe keywords, the JATS
    specification suggests that the @subj-group-type attribute have a value of, for example,
    &quot;keywords&quot;. However, we found the use of this attribute to be very inconsistent. Note
    in the &quot;good&quot; example above, that the value &quot;Discipline-v2&quot; is used. In a
    sample of articles from the OA subset, often we saw no value at all given for this attribute.
    Among those that did supply a value, we found the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Article Type</li>
    <li>Article type</li>
    <li>Primary</li>
    <li>Secondary</li>
    <li>hw-coll-titles</li>
    <li>hwp-journal-coll</li>
    <li>overline</li>
    <li>search-keyword</li>
    <li>section</li>
    <li>topic</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As with the keyword values themselves, this proliferation of values, with no centralized way to
    determine their semantics, makes them difficult to process by machine.</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>No keywords or subject tags</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>In many articles, no keywords or subject tags were given at all, other than the
    &quot;heading&quot; subject, which is not useful for this purpose. For example, <a
      href="http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&amp;id=PMC3425056"
      >PMC3425056</a> has only this markup:</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;subj-group</span><span class="ot"> subj-group-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;heading&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;subject&gt;</span>Case Report<span class="kw">&lt;/subject&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/subj-group&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <em>Inconsistent use of the @kwd-group-type attribute</em>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>As with the @subj-group-type attribute described above (and most of the attributes defined in
    JATS), there is no enumeration of, or constraint on, the values that this attribute can take.
    Publishers each choose their own values, and this leads to incompatibilities.</p>
  <p>The following are some of the values that we found:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>abbr</li>
    <li>author</li>
    <li>journal subjects</li>
    <li>KEYWORDS</li>
    <li>keywords</li>
    <li>kwd</li>
  </ul>
  <h1 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h1>
  <p>We will thus end by discussing some more long-term prospects for enhancing the discoverability
    of reuseable open-access content, combined with practical recommendations for how the current
    situation might be improved. </p>
  <h2 id="license-tagging-1">License tagging</h2>
  <p>We recommend that the PMC Tagging Guidelines and Style Checker be changed to require that, if a
    license is defined by a URI (as are CC licenses), that the article <em>must</em> put this URL
    into the @xlink:href on the &lt;license&gt; element. This should be the sole place that a
    machine (or anyone) should need to look for the license URI. (This is in contrast to the current
    guidelines, which state that it can be tagged on an @xlink:href on either the &lt;license&gt;
    element, or on any &lt;ext-link&gt; descendent of &lt;license&gt;.)</p>
  <p>If that were implemented, then it would no longer be necessary to do comparisons between that
    URI and any other URI within the &lt;license-p&gt; elements, and this check should be dropped.
    The rationale for this is that any content within the &lt;license-p&gt; elements is intended for
    human, not machine, consumption, and might contain arbitrary hyperlinks, which cannot be
    predicted, and should not be constrained.</p>
  <p>The PMC Style Checker could be enhanced to dynamically check the validity of any
    creativecommons.org URIs that appear in that attribute. Creative Commons provides a web service
    for this purpose (see, for example, <a
      href="http://api.creativecommons.org/rest/dev/details?license-uri=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/"
      >this service call</a>).</p>
  <h2 id="pmc-license-metadata">PMC license metadata</h2>
  <p>The license metadata for articles in the PMC archive, because it is based on the markup of the
    source XML, is not reliable. One effect of this, as discussed above, is that it detracts from
    the usefulness of the search-by-license feature.</p>
  <p>PMC could improve the way this license data is derived, re-using some of the business rules by
    which it determines which articles become part of the OA subset.</p>
  <p>Also, as part of this project, we curated the license data for thousands of articles in the PMC
    OA subset. It would be nice if PMC would incorporate that data back into their system, so that
    future users would not have to duplicate our effort.</p>
  <p>The license data that does reside in the PMC system should be better exposed. For example, we
    recommend that it be added to the E-utilities esummary output for articles, for both PubMed and
    PMC.</p>
  <p>For articles that have multiple licenses, which either change over time, or apply to different
    parts (for example, one license for the article proper, and another for data), we suggest that
    there be one &lt;license&gt; element for each, and that the @specific-use attribute be used to
    define the scope. The default scope would be &quot;article&quot;, but if, for example, there
    were a different license for the data, then that would be marked up as follows.</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;permissions&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span> 
<span class="ot">           xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>...<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           specific-use=</span><span class="st">&quot;scope: data&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>...<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/permissions&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <p>If the article has a license that changes over time, then that could be marked up as follows
    (this is meant to be suggestive, only).</p>
  <pre class="sourceCode xml"><code class="sourceCode xml"><span class="kw">&lt;permissions&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           specific-use=</span><span class="st">&quot;end-date: 2013-10-22&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>...<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
  <span class="kw">&lt;license</span><span class="ot"> license-type=</span><span class="st">&quot;open-access&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           specific-use=</span><span class="st">&quot;start-date: 2013-10-23&quot;</span>
<span class="ot">           xlink:href=</span><span class="st">&quot;http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/&quot;</span><span class="kw">&gt;</span>...<span class="kw">&lt;/license&gt;</span>
<span class="kw">&lt;/permissions&gt;</span></code></pre>
  <h2 id="media-types-and-format">Media types and format</h2>
  <p>The PMC Tagging Guidelines should be changed to require the media types to be in the @mimetype
    attribute only, and deprecate @mime-subtype. The Style Checker should verify that the @mimetype
    attribute is present, that it has a valid form, and that @mime-subtype is not given.</p>
  <p>PMC could develop a media type checking utility, using the same libmagic Unix library and data
    files, to be applied to data and media files that accompany articles for ingest. The system
    could fix the @mimetype attributes in the source XML to reflect the actual media types as
    determined by this library. As mentioned above, PMC has fixed the HTTP &quot;content-type&quot;
    headers, but if someone were to download the article and accompanying media files, and share
    them outside of the PMC system, the mismatch in the source XML could still be a problem.</p>
  <p>Perhaps this utility could also function to validate the multimedia and other data files that
    are received. Since these files form an integral part of the scientific record, just as with the
    source XML, the validity of these files is important. Since the operation of the OAMI began, we
    have found on the order of 100 video files which could not be processed, because some essential
    information (for example, the frame rate, or intermediate I-frames) is not given, or not in a
    proper way (<a href="http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=65463"
    >example</a>).</p>
  <p>Such a data validation system could start with a small set of file types, for which consistency
    checks could be set up. The consistency checker could be made available as a web service, and
    the Tagging Guidelines could recommend (but not require) that files be provided in those
    formats, and link to the web service.</p>
  <p>As mentioned above, <a
      href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/10055/RP-15-2013_Supplemental_Materials.pdf"
      >NISO RP-15-2013</a> has recently been published, and we encourage publishers to adopt these
    recommendations. We note that there is another paper within these conference proceedings,
      &quot;<a href="http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/2013/schedule2013a.html#2-900">Extending JATS
      to include the NISO/NFAIS Recommended Practices for Online Supplemental Journal Article
      Materials</a>&quot;, which might prove useful in this regard.</p>
  <p>However, we would also like to note that we have concerns about these recommendations, that
    mirror some of the concerns that we have expressed about JATS in general. Specifically, we feel
    that the recommendations are, in many cases, not conducive to producing consistent, robust, and
    machine readable metadata.</p>
  <p>For example, in the description of the <a
      href="http://supplemental.niso.org/tag-library/index.html?elem=license">&lt;license&gt;</a>
    element, they say, &quot;The &lt;ext-link&gt; can be used to link to licenses that are already
    defined, such as a Creative Commons license.&quot; This should not be discretionary. The
    specification should be explicit that when a URI exists that identifies a license, that it must
    be included, and in a well-defined place. Note that this schema allows multiple &lt;ext-link&gt;
    elements under &lt;license&gt;, so the ambiguities that exist in JATS, that have led to such
    wide variation in tagging of this metadata, are continued in this new recommendation.</p>
  <h2 id="keywords-1">Keywords</h2>
  <p>As mentioned above, we support the suggestion on the <a
      href="http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/view_comment.php?comment_id=252">NISO JATS
      document page</a> requesting that the &lt;kwd-group&gt; element be added to the content model
    of several new elements, including &lt;media&gt; and &lt;supplementary-material&gt;.</p>
  <h2 id="public-versioning-of-pmcoa-xml-files">Public versioning of PMC/OA XML files</h2>
  <p>Many of the issues discussed here could in principle be fixed by running some dedicated scripts
    over the affected XML files. However, even if such scripts were functional and readily
    available, there is currently no mechanism that would allow such fixes to be fed back
    systematically and automatically to the respective sources of these XML files, or to third-party
    copies thereof. One step in this direction would be to make the XML files available in an
    updatable environment with public versioning. This would be possible for articles in the Open
    Access Subset. Indeed, <a href="https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xml">eLife</a> and <a
      href="https://github.com/pensoft">Pensoft</a> have demoed this on GitHub, and a tool for <a
      href="https://github.com/konrad/JATS-to-Mediawiki">porting JATS XML to MediaWiki
      environments</a> exists as well.</p>
  <p>Various kinds of modifications to existing XML are theoretically plausible that would merit
    adoption of such a system. These include – but are not limited to – typos, corrigenda and
    retractions, but also license changes (e.g. when copyright owner changes licensing backwards, or
    when copyright expires), media type mismatches, missing or mixed up files, captions or unique

  <p>So far, JATS has mainly been used to exchange information between publishers and archives.
    Under traditional notions of copyright, large-scale reuse of such information by third parties
    is very limited but PMC's Open Access Subset – particularly the Wikimedia-compatibly licensed
    portions thereof – opens the door for experimentation on this front. We see value here in
    introducing the concept of use cases and collaborating with suitable use case partners in
    further developing JATS as well as the corresponding guidelines and style checkers. The OAMI bot
    could serve as one such use case. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-85">Species
