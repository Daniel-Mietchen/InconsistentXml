# Title

Inconsistent XML as a barrier to reuse of Open Access Content

# Abstract

In this paper, we will describe the current state of some of the tagging of articles 
within the [PMC Open Access subset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/). 
As a case study, we will use our experiences 
developing the [Open Access Media 
Importer](https://github.com/erlehmann/open-access-media-importer), a tool to harvest 
content from the OA subset for automated upload to [Wikimedia 
Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Open_Access_Media_Importer).

Tagging inconsistencies stretch across several aspects of the articles, ranging from 
licensing to keywords to the media types of supplementary materials. While all of these 
complicate large-scale reuse, the unclear licensing statements had the greatest impact,
requiring us to implement 
text mining-like algorithms in order to accurately determine whether or not specific 
content was compatible with reuse on Wikimedia Commons.

Besides presenting examples of incorrectly tagged XML from a range of publishers, we 
will also explore past and current efforts towards standardization of license tagging, 
and we will describe a set of recommendations related to tagging practices of certain
data, to ensure that it is both compatible with existing standards, and consistent and 
machine-readable.


# Introduction

## Scope of this paper

The aim of this paper is to describe the problems that we came across when attempting 
to reuse materials from the [PMC Open Access 
Subset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/) in an automated fashion and 
at scale. Some of the issues are specific to certain kinds of content, others are a barrier 
to reuse more generally. Some of them are specific to individual articles, journals or 
publishers, while others apply more widely. 

In discussing these issues, we take the perspective of a re-user of JATS-conveyed 
content, conscious of the possibility that the perspectives of producers and curators 
of this content and of maintainers of JATS standards may differ. We conclude with a 
series of recommendations that would have facilitated the implementation of our reuse 
project and that could serve as the basis for a discussion on how to facilitate reuse more generally.

## The Open Access Media Importer

The [Open Access Media 
Importer](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Open_Access_Media_Importer_Bot)
is an automated bot, developed with [initial support](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/User:OpenScientist/Open_grant_writing/Wissenswert_2011) from [Wikimedia 
Deutschland](http://www.wikimedia.de/wiki/Hauptseite), that harvests 
multimedia content from open access repositories, and uploads that content to [Wikimedia 
Commons](http://commons.wikimedia.org/), the media repository used by the Wikipedias and their sister project.  Once in Wikimedia Commons, those multimedia 
files are very easy to insert into Wikipedia pages, and to be reused on a wide variety 
of other wikis and Wikimedia projects.

Currently, the OAMI harvests content from the PMC Open Access Subset.  Since most articles in the subset 
are actually not Open Access (in the sense of being free to reuse, revise, remix and 
redistribute), the bot scans the XML sources of new articles and reads the license 
information in order to determine those that are. It then checks whether these have 
multimedia files in their supplementary materials. If so, they are downloaded, 
converted and uploaded to Wikimedia Commons along with the available metadata. At the 
time of writing, [over 13,000 multimedia 
files](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Uploaded_with_Open_Access_Media_Importer)
had been processed this way.  Figure 1 illustrates the timeline of uploads per day from the OAMI
to Wikimedia Commons, from its inception up to the present time.

# License tagging

As mentioned above, an important function of the OAMI is to determine, for each media file,
the license under which it or its parent article has been released. 

In reading and analyzing the license data, the OAMI looks for licenses that are truly
open, in the sense of being free to reuse, revise, remix and redistribute, as laid out in the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org/read) a decade ago.  Licenses with
"non-commercial" and "no derivatives" clauses are [not acceptable](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Licensing) on Wikimedia Commons.  Figure 2 shows
a breakdown of the licenses we have found in the PMC OA subset for articles indexed during the first week of May this year, with color-coding to
illustrate which licenses are "free" in the sense of allowing reuse on Wikimedia Commons, 
and which are not. More formal definitions of this sense of freedom can be found in the 
[Definition of Free Cultural Works](http://freedomdefined.org/) and the [Open 
Definition](http://opendefinition.org/).

![Figure 2.  Licenses of supplementary materials in the PMC OA subset, by license 
URI, for the first week of May 2013](http://daten.dieweltistgarnichtso.net/tmp/pics/licenses.png)


This information is tagged in the source XML for
each article.  In the rest of this section, we will review the JATS elements and attributes related to
license data, and then describe some of the problems we encountered when trying to harvest
this data from actual articles.

In JATS 1.0, there are several XML elements and attributes that are used to specify 
license information for an article and its accompanying multimedia files.

* [\<permissions>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=permissions) - 
  this is a container element, within which all copyright and license metadata 
  should appear
* [\<license>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license) - this 
  is the main element for specifying license information.  Among the 
  attributes allowed on this element, the following are relevant:

    * [@license-type](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=license-type) - 
      the value is not constrained; "open-access" is one suggested value.
    * [@xlink:href](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=xlink:href) -
      takes an external URL; often the URL identifying the specific Creative Commons
      license.

* [\<license-p>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license-p) -
  paragraph of text within a \<license> element.  Semantically, this is a
  [\<p>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=p) element with the
  addition of [\<price>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=price)
  to the content model. (Prior to the NLM Tag Set version 3.0, the \<p> element was used
  here.)

* [\<ext-link>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=ext-link) -
  can appear within the \<license-p> element, and provides a link to an external
  resource.  This also takes an optional `xlink:href` attribute.

An example of good license tagging, from the [JATS 1.0 Tag Library
documentation](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=license),
is the following.

```xml
<permissions>
  ...
  <license license-type="open-access"
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">
    <license-p>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the
      Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use,
      distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original
      work is properly cited.</license-p>
  </license>
</permissions>
```

In the above example, the Creative Commons license is unambiguously identified by the 
URI in the @xlink:href attribute of the \<license> element.  The \<license-p> element 
provides the human-readable text of the license, which matches the machine-readable 
version (except for not including the version number of the Creative Commons license, and the hyperlink.)

***PMC Tagging Guidelines and Style Checker***

PMC provides additional recommendations and specifications for article tagging, which
are layered on top of the requirements of the JATS standard.  These are documented at the [PMC Tagging
Guidelines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/style.html),
and they include guidelines for tagging [license 
information](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/dobs.html#dob-license).

Recently, in part in order to minimize some of the inconsistencies in tagging
that are described below, PMC has amended these to include the following statement:

> When including a URI for a license, the URI should be included either on the \<license> 
> in @xlink:href (preferred) or in an \<ext-link> in the content of the license. The URI 
> must not be tagged in both places.

Complementing that, the [Style 
Checker](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/stylechecker/) now has additional checks
to help ensure the consistency of the license information.  In particular, it will generate
an error if there is an `xlink:href` attribute on the \<license> element, and one on
a descendent \<ext-link> element, and the URIs do not match.

Unfortunately, these recent changes do little to address most of the problems described in
this paper.  We provide some recommendations for how these resources could be further
improved, in the *Recommendations* section, below.


## Problems encountered by the bot

While developing and deploying the OAMI, we discovered that automatically discerning the 
licensing terms and reuse rights was non-trivial. Â In contrast to the example of "good" 
markup above, within the article XML available from the PMC OA subset, licensing metadata 
is not expressed consistently across journals, and sometimes not even across different 
articles of the same journal. Â Here, we list a few examples.

***Contradictory information***

In many cases, the URI identifying the Creative Commons license was contradicted by the 
human-readable text. Â For example, from the article 
[PMC2658715](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC2658715) ([publisher 
version](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05520.x/abstract)), the
URI specifies "CC-BY", but the human-readable description adds the extra "NC" (non-commercial)
restriction:

```xml
<license license-type="open-access" 
         xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">
  <p>Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Creative Commons Deed, 
    Attribution 2.5, which does not permit commercial exploitation.</p>
</license>
```

In other examples, the human-readable descriptions were actually self-contradictory.
The following is an example from 
[PMC3143982](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3143982) that also has a typo in the license name.

```xml
<license license-type="open-access">
  <license-p>This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attr0ibution 3.0 License 
    (by-nc 3.0).</license-p>
  ...
</license>
```

We have found that
the phenomenon of self-contradictory licenses is rather common and not 
restricted to small and lesser known publishers.  The next example is from
[PMC3468739](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3468739/). 
While the machine-readable license is CC BY, the 
human-readable version has a non-commercial clause.

```xml
<license license-type="open-access" 
         xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/">
  <license-p>Re-use of this article is permitted in accordance with the Creative 
    Commons Deed, Attribution 2.5, which does not permit commercial 
    exploitation.</license-p>
</license>
```

***License information outside the \<license> element***

In the following example, from 
[PMC3158088](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3158088/), the Creative Commons 
license text is given in the
\<copyright-statement> element rather than the \<license> element.  

```xml
<permissions>
  <copyright-statement>
    Uosaki et al. This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of 
    the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, 
    distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author 
    and source are credited.
  </copyright-statement>
  <copyright-year>2011</copyright-year>
</permissions>
```

These statements in the \<copyright-statement> element may 
([PMC3605902](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3143982PMC3605902/)) or may not 
([PMC3589467](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3143982PMC3589467/)) contain an 
`xlink:href` attribute, even within otherwise identical license text.


At the time of this writing, PMC has [281,148 author 
manuscripts](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22author+manuscript%22%5Bfilter%5D), of which 
[5383](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22author+manuscript%22%5Bfilter%5D+AND+%22open+access%22%5Bfilter%5D)
(about 2%) are in the OA subset.  In a sample of those that are not in the OA
subset, it was found that 1%, do in fact have a Creative Commons license, but
the license information is completely outside of the \<permissions> element.  For 
example, in [PMC3717328](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3143982PMC3717328/), 
the license information is given in a \<fn> element within the back matter:

```xml
<fn id="FN5">
  <p content-type="publisher-disclaimer">
    <bold>Open Access</bold>: This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative
    Commons Attribution License 3.0 which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in
    any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited. To view a copy of
    the license, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
      xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/"
    >http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</ext-link>
  </p>
</fn>
```

This effectively makes it undiscoverable, because any automatic process attempting to
determine the license of an article would have to exclude things outside of the 
\<permissions> element, otherwise there would be the possibility of false positives
resulting from articles that *discuss* and *quote* licenses and license text within the 
article body.

***Contradictory URIs***

Until recently, many articles in PMC had mismatches between the URIs that appear
on the \<license> element and those that appear inside the license text within
\<ext-link> elements.  To address this problem, as mentioned above, PMC has instituted a 
new Style Checker rule that requires 
that if there are multiple URIs, they must match.

In addition, PMC has fixed most instances of such conflicts within the existing
database.


***No machine-readable URI***

Some articles (including the vast majority of those deposited by PLOS) have Creative Commons
licenses, but don't contain any machine-readable URI identifying that license.
An example of the tagging from a recent PLOS ONE article, 
[PMC3738584](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3738584/), is:

```xml
<permissions>
  <copyright-year>2013</copyright-year>
  <copyright-holder>Bassaneze et al</copyright-holder>
  <license>
    <license-p>This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the 
      Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, 
      distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author 
      and source are credited.</license-p>
  </license>
</permissions>
```

This is particularly troubling, since PLOS papers represent a large and quickly 
increasing percentage of PMC, and especially PMC's OA content. Additionally, the phrasing of the human-readable text may vary across articles from the same journal that are under the same license.

***Missing license information altogether***

Finally, there are the cases of articles in the OA subset (e.g. 
[PMC3775889](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3775889/)) that have no 
license information in the XML at all, meaning that an automated tool would either 
have to consider the article to be under "all rights reserved" &ndash; which would 
even prohibit the kind 
of data mining that the OA subset is intended for and that the OAMI performs &ndash; 
or to contain code specific to particular journals or publishers, or require manual 
assistance by a human (who, in the case of the cited example, would find out that 
the article in question is [actually licensed CC 
BY](http://currents.plos.org/genomictests/terms-of-use/)).  

## Impact of these problems on PMC

PMC recently implemented a search-by-license feature, described on their
[Open Access Subset](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/) page.
This feature allows users to query for articles matching specific Creative
Commons licenses, and can be combined with other search terms.  

Unfortunately, because of the tagging problems described above, the PMC indexer,
in many cases, cannot correctly determine the license of articles.  Therefore,
the search result sets are much smaller than they otherwise would be.

For example, in a sample of 100 articles that are in the OA subset, but that
do not match the "cc license" filter ([PMC search](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=%22open+access%22%5Bfilter%5D+NOT+%22cc+license%22%5Bfilter%5D)), 
it was found that 99 did, in fact, have
CC licenses, but that tagging problems prevented them from being correctly 
identified as such.  At the time of this writing, there were 663,843 articles
in the OA subset, and 52% did not match the "cc license" filter.  If the sample
described above is representative, then that means about 340,000 eligible articles
would not be discoverable through this search feature.


## Impact of these problems beyond PMC

In the OAMI, 
these problems necessitated the development of a fairly sophisticated text-mining 
module that examined both the machine-readable URI in the \<license> element, as 
well as the human-readable expressions, so as to determine the publisher's intent. 
Because of Wikimedia Commons' strict enforcement of proper licensing, it was 
important that this module be conservative: Â false positives being much less 
acceptable than false negatives.

Development of a license-mining algorithm such as this is costly, and would
tax the resources of any project seeking to reuse PMC OA content.  Even with
this algorithm, the inconsistency and number of errors that we found indicate
that there are still a great number of articles that could legitimately be uploaded 
to Wikimedia Commons, but that are not properly identified. This does a disservice 
to those who released their material with 
reuse-friendly licenses, often in the hopes of having it be used as widely as 
possible.

The lack of ability to reliably determine licensing information on a per-article basis 
contributes to other problems as well.  One such problem is that publishers sometimes 
erect paywalls around open access content, counter to the express wishes of the authors.
One way to explain this could be that the sites are not flexible enough to
handle per-issue or per-article license information.  Perhaps, if the tagging of
this information in JATS XML documents were consistent and reliable, it would 
facilitate systems that were more flexible, and able to serve open content directly,
which still presenting a paywall for closed content.

As another example, the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) already allows one
to [list journals by license](http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=byLicense), and plans are 
afoot to expand this functionality to the level of individual articles.  Again, this
could be facilitated by consistent and reliable tagging of JATS XML articles.


## Broader license issues

***Multiple licenses with different scope***

Recently, some journals have begun to make data and supplementary materials available 
under a license that differs from the main article's license.
For example, F1000Research is providing articles with text content that is available under
CC-BY, but with accompanying data available in the public domain (CC0).  Here is an
example of the tagging of a recent article from their website:

```xml
<permissions>
  <copyright-statement>Copyright: Â© 2013 Baird AH et al.</copyright-statement>
  <copyright-year>2013</copyright-year>
  <license license-type="open-access" 
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">
    <license-p>This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the 
      Creative Commons Attribution Licence, which permits unrestricted use, 
      distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is 
      properly cited.</license-p>
  </license>
  <license license-type="open-access" 
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">
    <license-p>Data associated with the article are available under the terms of 
      the Creative Commons Zero "No rights reserved" data waiver (CC0 1.0 Public 
      domain dedication).</license-p>
  </license>
</permissions>
```

The scope and the intent of each of the two \<license> elements is clear to a 
human reader, but, unfortunately, there is no way for an automated bot to be able
to unambiguously identify the two different scopes.

If licensing information were available along with provenance on a per-file basis 
in a machine-readable format, there would be potential for automated checks of 
licensing information. Few scholars outside the field of copyright law are aware 
of all the implications of publishing under certain licenses, which sometimes 
leads to content available under a particular license being published ([Example 
1](http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=60001)) or re-published 
([Example 2](http://www.plosbiology.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=53679)) 
in incompatibly licensed papers. In Example 1, the issue could be solved by the 
copyright holder changing the licensing of the original file, whereas in Example 
2, a video displaying wrong license information was fixed and re-uploaded at the 
publisher's site but [not at 
PMC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3485268/bin/pone.0046962.s003.mp4), 
despite the published correction. 

There is no straightforward way to detect such cases algorithmically, and raising 
awareness for these issues amongst authors, editors and reviewers can certainly 
not be automated either.

***Incremental licenses***

Often, articles are published with license terms that change over time.  The following
is an example from 
[PMC3601365](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.cgi?db=pmc&id=3601365).

```xml
<license license-type="openaccess">
  <license-p>
    This article is distributed under the terms of an Attributionâ€“Noncommercialâ€“Share 
    Alikeâ€“No Mirror Sites license for the first six months after the publication date 
    (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" 
      xlink:href="http://www.rupress.org/terms">http://www.rupress.org/terms</ext-link>). 
    After six months it is available under a Creative Commons License 
    (Attributionâ€“Noncommercialâ€“Share Alike 3.0 Unported license, as described at
    <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" 
      xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">
    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/</ext-link>).
  </license-p>
</license>
```

One problem with this is that both licenses are given within a single \<license>
element, which would complicate the data model for any program attempting to 
process these.  Another is that there is no machine-readable indication of the time
period covered by each of the two separate licenses.  

We provide a recommendation
of how this tagging could be improved (both for licenses with different scope, and
with different effective date ranges) in "PMC license metadata", below.


## Standardization efforts

There have been a number of efforts to standardize the expression of license metadata.
Among these are:

* [Creative Commons Rights Expression Language](http://creativecommons.org/ns) (CC-REL)
* [ONIX for Publications Licenses](http://www.editeur.org/21/ONIX-PL/) (ONIX-PL)
* Ongoing [NISO Initiative to Develop Standard for Open Access Metadata and 
  Indicators](http://www.niso.org/news/pr/view?item_key=d2e5f409bc6af6b7f504a10edf0329203ffec6f9)
* [Wikipedia: Signalling 
  OA-ness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Open_Access/Signalling_OA-ness)

Many of these standards provide complex mechanisms for specifying or customizing the 
particular terms of a license.  We welcome these efforts, and look forward to the time
when the tags they define can be integrated with JATS.  However, the simplest and most fundamental
way of robustly signalling a license will probably always be to unambiguously link to a 
URI that's defined, controlled and perhaps versioned by an established organization such as Creative Commons.


# Media types

In addition to the problems with communicating the licensing terms, the media types of 
supplementary materials are frequently not indicated properly, which reduces 
discoverability and translates into extra efforts before any reuse becomes possible.

Media types (originally called "MIME types") are two part identifiers that describe the
format of a multimedia file.  Familiar examples are "text/plain", and "application/xml".
When serving these types of files, web servers provide the media type in the
HTTP "Content-type" header.  This allows the client to determine
how the file should be processed.  In the case of the OAMI, the processing is the conversion 
of the file format, since Wikimedia Commons only accepts audio or video files encoded in open formats.

The JATS standard provides two attributes to allow for encoding the media types of files
that accompany journal articles:

* [mimetype](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=mimetype)
* [mime-subtype](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=mime-subtype)

These attributes are allowed on several elements that identify these types of files,
including
[\<supplementary-material>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=supplementary-material) 
and
[\<media>](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?elem=media).

The JATS specification includes the following example of how to tag a media file in
an article's supplementary material (slightly elided):

```xml
<supplementary-material id="S1" xlink:href="1471-2105-1-1-s1.pdf"
                        mimetype="application/pdf">
  <caption>
    <p>Supplementary PDF file supplied by authors.</p>
  </caption>
</supplementary-material>
```

Note:

* The `mimetype` attribute is used to store both parts of the media type, rather than
  splitting out the "subtype" into the `mime-subtype` attribute
* The information about the media file is given right on the \<supplementary-material>
  element, rather than, for example, a child \<media> element.

In contrast, the [PMC Tagging 
Guidelines](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/pmcdoc/tagging-guidelines/article/tags.html#el-suppl) 
stipulate, for the \<supplementary-material> element:

> Should include \<media> or \<graphic> to identify the supplemental file. File description in 
> \<media> or \<graphic> must include the file name (including file extension) in @xlink:href; 
> \<media> also requires @mime-type [sic], and @mime-subtype.

So, there is some ambiguity as to the best practice for tagging supplementary media files.


## Media type and related problems

The following are some examples of the problems that we encountered that are related to 
media types.  

Foremost were those resulting from mismatches among:

* The declared media type in the @mimetype and @mime-subtype attributes of the source XML,
  including mismatches between the XML available from the publisher and PMC,
* The "Content-type" headers as seen from PMC, and
* The actual media type of the file.


***Mismatches between publisher XML, PMC XML, and Content-type***

The following figure suggests the scope of the problem of media type mismatches.

![Figure 3.  Supplementary media files with the wrong media type, by DOI 
prefix, from a sample of articles indexed in the first week of May 2013. Unknown refers to MS Office files, between the different formats of which we did not distinguish.](http://chrismaloney.org/notes/mediatype-mismatches-by-publisher.png)

For an example of such a mismatch, in the article 
[PMC3162007](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3162007/), 
the [Models 
S1](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3162007/bin/pone.0023819.s009.rar) file 
under "Supporting Information" is actually of type "application/x-rar-compressed".  The 
original [publisher XML](http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObjectAttachment.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0023819&representation=XML) encodes this correctly:

```xml
<supplementary-material id="pone.0023819.s009" mimetype="application/x-rar-compressed" ...
```

However, the [XML from 
PMC](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3162007) 
is wrong:

```xml
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0023819.s009">
  ...
  <media xlink:href="pone.0023819.s009.rar" mimetype="audio" mime-subtype="x-realaudio">
  ...
```

Furthermore, PMC returns the (wrong) HTTP "Content-Type" header "application/octet-stream".

***Mismatches between filename extension and media type***

In the article [PMC2386968](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC2386968/),
the URL to the [Movie 
S2](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC2386968/bin/pone.0002276.s002.doc) ends
with ".doc", and PMC returns "Content-Type: application/msword".  However, the file
is actually a Microsoft ASF file, which should have media type "video/x-ms-wmv".

The [PMC XML](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC2386968) 
is wrong:

```xml
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002276.s002">
  ...
  <media xlink:href="pone.0002276.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword">
  ...
```

***Media type misidentified in publisher XML***

In the article 
[PMC3619089](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3619089/), the additional
data file is a [video](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3619089/bin/Movie_1.MP4)
that has an actual media type of "video/mp4", but this is
tagged incorrectly in the [publisherâ€™s XML](http://www.frontiersin.org/Journal/DownloadFile.ashx?xml=1&FileId=15567&articleId=41661&Version=1&ContentTypeId=22&FileName=Finalxml.xml&JournalAbbr=fnbot&JournalSeqNo=00005&JournalVolume=07) (notice the misspelling):

```xml
<supplementary-material xlink:href="Movie_1.MP4" id="SM1" mimetype="applicationn/MP4" ...
```

The [PMC XML](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3619089) 
is wrong too, but in a different way:

```xml
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1">
  <media xlink:href="Movie_1.MP4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="quicktime">
  ...
```

***Missing media type in XML***

Many articles lack any indication of the media type within their XML.  For
example, in the article
[PMC3765204](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3765204/), there is no
media type indicated for either Movie 1 or Movie 2.  The two videos in 
[PMC3770602](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3770602/) also
lack any indication of media type.

The problem of missing @mimetype and @mime-subtype attributes is fairly common.
For example, in the article 
[PMC3765681](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3765681/), the XML lacks any
indication of the media type:

```xml
<media xlink:href="1556-276X-8-131-S1.tiff">
  <caption>
    <p>Click here for file</p>
  </caption>
</media>
```

After September, 2013, when PMC stopped writing these attributes into source XML (see
"Recent efforts at PMC", below) the frequency
of this problem went up, but the frequency of incorrect attribute values went down, as would
be expected.


***Problems with \<label>, \<caption> and \<title>***

In addition to problems involving the media types, there is also a lot of variability in
the way that the \<label>, \<caption> and \<title> elements are used, and this causes problems
for automated tools.

For instance, in 
[PMC3713652](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3713652),
the caption for several supplementary files is given in the first caption element, and
there is no way to automate the process of determining which caption should go with 
which file:

```xml
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1">
  <caption>
    ...
    <p>Supplemental Figure 1. Micrographs illustrating ...</p>
    <p>Supplemental Figure 2. Merged image of RANKL, FN, ...</p>
    ...
  </caption>
  <media xlink:href="876316.f1.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo">
    <caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption>
  </media>
</supplementary-material>
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f2">
  <media xlink:href="876316.f2.avi" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo">
    <caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption>
  </media>
</supplementary-material>
...
```

Other articles, for example,
[PMC3656359](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3656359),
do not provide any content-related information in the captions:

```xml
<supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1">
  <media xlink:href="43049_Jiang_Movie1.AVI" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="x-msvideo">
    <caption>
      <p>Click here for additional data file.</p>
    </caption>
  </media>
</supplementary-material>
```

***Missing references to supplementary materials***

In a few cases, the source XML of suitably licensed articles available from PMC
do not have any reference to the multimedia files whatsoever.  For example
[PMC3104346](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3104346)
has two supplemental videos, which can be viewed [on the publisher's 
site](http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/59/787/suppl/DC1), but are 
not referenced in the XML.

Another example of this is 
[PMC3423924](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=3423924),
which has a supplemental video that can be downloaded from the
[publisher site](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijad/2012/914947/sup/), but, again,
no reference to that from the XML.


## Recent efforts at PMC

Many of the problems described above were due to PMC's incorrectly adding @mimetype and
@mime-subtype attributes to XML that it received, based on the assumption that the media file's extension accurately reflects its media type.
When it was recognized that the filename extension was not a reliable indicator of
the media type, and that it's better to have no declared media type than to have it
wrong, PMC has stopped executing this function.

Also, in part because of the recognition that the values for @mimetype and @mime-subtype
being supplied by publishers was not reliable, PMC is in the process of changing the Tagging
Guidelines to make these attributes, when they appear on the \<media> element, optional.

Also, in response to some of these problems, PMC has implemented a new feature in its 
rendering software to ensure the accuracy of the "Content-type" header it provides in response 
to HTTP requests for the media files.  This makes use of the standard Unix library 
[libmagic](http://netbsd.gw.com/cgi-bin/man-cgi?libmagic+3+NetBSD-current), which is also used by the OAMI and determines
a file's type based on patterns of data within its content.  In this way, PMC can be sure
that it is delivering accurate metadata in the HTTP response, based on the actual
file at the time it is served.

There are no plans to retroactively fix the existing XML markup in the PMC database,
or to adjust the @mimetype or @mime-subtype attributes for any new articles received.


## Standardization efforts

Over the past few years, the NISO/NFAIS Supplemental Journal Article Materials Working 
Group has been working on standards for handling supplementary materials, and has published 
[NISO RP-15-2013, Recommended Practices for Online Supplemental Journal Article 
Materials](http://www.niso.org/publications/rp/rp-15-2013) earlier this year.

This document lists "recommended minimal and extended metadata" (section B.2.2 
Metadata Elements), and recommends open formats that can be rendered by free, open-source, 
and ubiquitous application software (section B.4.2 Preservation Recommendations) 
and also briefly touches upon licensing (section A.3.10 Rights Management). With 
respect to media types, the group recommends &ndash; as part of a strategy to 
enable long-term preservation &ndash; that publishers accept supplementary materials 
in formats defined in formal format registries, such as the [Unified Digital Format 
Registry (UDFR)](http://www.udfr.org/)
or [PRONOM](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM). These formats provide much 
more information than the simple media type.

The kind of media type issues reported here would be much less frequent in articles properly 
tagged according to these NISO recommendations.


# Keywords

The OAMI, when it uploads files to Wikimedia Commons, assigns them to Wikimedia 
Commons categories, so as to facilitate search and discovery by users.  The OAMI attempts to 
determine these categories based on keywords or subjects in the source XML, or
MeSH terms supplied by the journal, by PMC or by PubMed for the corresponding article.
We found that articles within the OA subset had very inconsistent tagging of 
keywords, and that caused many problems.

The NISO JATS specification provides recommendations in the [Tagging 
Keywords](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/0.4/n-pu72.html) section of
each of the three tag sets.  It describe two main methods for tagging
keywords:

1.  With any of a number of elements inside \<kwd-group>: \<kwd>, \<compound-kwd>,
  \<compound-kwd-part>, \<nested-kwd>, and \<unstructured-kwd-group>
2.  With \<subject> elements inside \<subj-group>, inside \<article-categories>

## Tagging with kwd-family elements

The \<kwd-group> element is a container for other elements that specify the keywords
themselves.  It takes
an attribute, @kwd-group-type, that qualifies the type of keywords that appear in
the group.  The JATS specification [page for this 
attribute](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.0/?attr=kwd-group-type)
indicates that it should be used for either of two purposes:  defining the authority
of a controlled vocabulary from which the keywords come, or for describing the type
of the keywords as "hierarchical", "abbreviation", etc.  (This is an unfortunate
conflation of two orthogonal concepts.)  

The \<kwd-group> element can appear within either article or section metadata.
Unfortunately, at present, it cannot be applied to individual media or data files.
However, there is a [comment on the NISO 
site](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/view_comment.php?comment_id=252) requesting
that this attribute be added to several other elements, including \<media> and
\<supplementary-material>, and we support this suggestion.

The following is an example of the typical usage of \<kwd-group> and \<kwd>, from 
[PMC2630158](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=2630158):

```xml
<kwd-group>
  <kwd>French pox</kwd>
  <kwd>Augsburg</kwd>
  <kwd>medical semiotics</kwd>
  <kwd>diagnosis</kwd>
  <kwd>hospital</kwd>
</kwd-group>
```


## Tagging with \<subject>

In many articles, keywords are tagged within \<subject> elements, that are nested
hierarchically inside \<subj-group> elements.

An example of reasonably good tagging is from 
[PMC3708714](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3708714),
where the keywords are specified in a clean hierarchical structure inside \<subj-group> 
and \<subject> elements:

```xml
<subj-group subj-group-type="Discipline-v2">
  <subject>Biology</subject>
  <subj-group>
    <subject>Biophysics</subject>
    <subj-group>
      <subject>Nucleic Acids</subject>
      <subj-group>
        <subject>DNA</subject>
      </subj-group>
    </subj-group>
  </subj-group>
  <subj-group>
    <subject>Computational Biology</subject>
    <subj-group>
      <subject>Molecular Genetics</subject>
      <subj-group>
        <subject>Gene Regulation</subject>
      </subj-group>
    </subj-group>
  </subj-group>
  ...
  <subj-group>
    <subject>Synthetic Biology</subject>
  </subj-group>
</subj-group>
```

## Tagging problems

***Bad keywords***

Because the values for keywords are unconstrained, and typically not members
of a controlled vocabulary, there is no way to validate them.  This, of course, 
leads to problems with typos, misspellings, differences in case, and so forth,
that make them difficult to process by machine.

For example, we have noticed that in PLOS articles, a recurring typographical
error is encountered, in which a superfluous space is inserted into a keyword.
When media files from these articles are processed by the OAMI and uploaded to 
Wikimedia Commons, they are thus assigned the Wikimedia Commons category 
"[Biophysic al 
simulations](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Biophysic_al_simulations)".
To work around this problem, we have inserted a permanent redirect from that
misspelled category to one with the proper spelling.  The presence of files in this redirected category then
triggers another bot on Wikimedia Commons to fix the categorization of affected 
files automatically.


***Inconsistent use of the @subj-group-type attribute***

Most of the time, the \<subj-group> and \<subject> elements are used to specify,
not keywords, but a subject heading that would appear in the Table of Contents for
a journal issue; and is often equivalent to the type of article, as "Article", 
"Letter to Editor", "Meeting Notice", etc.  When used this way, the @subj-group-type 
attribute normally has the value "heading".

When using \<subj-group> and \<subject> elements to describe keywords, the JATS specification
suggests that the @subj-group-type attribute have a value of, for example,
"keywords".  However, we found the use of this attribute to be very inconsistent.
Note in the "good" example above, that the value "Discipline-v2" is used.
In a sample of articles from the OA subset, often we saw no value at all given for this 
attribute.  Among those that did supply a value, we found the following:

* Article Type
* Article type
* Primary
* Secondary
* hw-coll-titles
* hwp-journal-coll
* overline
* search-keyword
* section
* topic

As with the keyword values themselves, this proliferation of values, with no 
centralized way to determine their semantics, makes them difficult to process
by machine.

***No keywords or subject tags***

In many articles, no keywords or subject tags were given at all, other than 
the "heading" subject, which is not useful for this purpose.  For example,
[PMC3425056](http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pmc&id=PMC3425056)
has only this markup:

```xml
<subj-group subj-group-type="heading">
  <subject>Case Report</subject>
</subj-group>
```

***Inconsistent use of the @kwd-group-type attribute***

As with the @subj-group-type attribute described above (and most of the attributes defined
in JATS), there is no enumeration of, or constraint on, the values that this attribute 
can take.  Publishers each choose their own values, and this leads to incompatibilities.

The following are some of the values that we found:

* abbr
* author
* journal subjects
* KEYWORDS
* keywords
* kwd


# Recommendations

We will thus end by discussing some more long-term prospects for enhancing the 
discoverability of reuseable open-access content, combined with practical recommendations 
for how the current situation might be improved.Â 


## License tagging

We recommend that the PMC Tagging Guidelines and Style Checker be changed to require that,
if a license is defined by a URI (as are CC licenses), that the article *must* put this 
URL into the @xlink:href on the \<license> element.  This should be the sole place that a 
machine (or anyone) should need to look for the license URI.  (This is in contrast to the current 
guidelines, which state that it can be tagged on an @xlink:href on either the \<license> 
element, or on any \<ext-link> descendent of \<license>.)  

If that were implemented, then it would no longer be necessary to do comparisons 
between that URI and any other URI within the \<license-p> elements, and this check
should be dropped.  The rationale for this is that any content within the 
\<license-p> elements is intended for human, not machine, consumption, and might 
contain arbitrary hyperlinks, which cannot be predicted, and should not be constrained.

The PMC Style Checker could be enhanced to dynamically check the validity of any
creativecommons.org URIs that appear in that attribute.  Creative Commons provides
a web service for this purpose (see, for example, [this service 
call](http://api.creativecommons.org/rest/dev/details?license-uri=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/ca/)).


## PMC license metadata

The license metadata for articles in the PMC archive, because it is based on the
markup of the source XML, is not reliable.  One effect of this, as discussed above, is 
that it detracts from the usefulness of the search-by-license feature.

PMC could improve the way this license data is derived, re-using some of the business
rules by which it determines which articles become part of the OA subset.

Also, as part of this project, we curated the license data for thousands of articles in the
PMC OA subset.  It would be nice if PMC would incorporate that data back into their
system, so that future users would not have to duplicate our effort.

The license data that does reside in the PMC system should be better exposed.  For example, 
we recommend that it be added to the E-utilities esummary output for articles, for both 
PubMed and PMC.

For articles that have multiple licenses, which either change over time, or apply
to different parts (for example, one
license for the article proper, and another for data), we suggest that there be
one \<license> element for each, and that the @specific-use attribute be used to 
define the scope.  The default scope would be "article", but if, for example, there
were a different license for the data, then that would be marked up as follows.

```xml
<permissions>
  <license license-type="open-access" 
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">...</license>
  <license license-type="open-access"
           specific-use="scope: data"
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">...</license>
</permissions>
```

If the article has a license that changes over time, then that could be marked up
as follows (this is meant to be suggestive, only).

```xml
<permissions>
  <license license-type="open-access"
           specific-use="end-date: 2013-10-22"
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">...</license>
  <license license-type="open-access"
           specific-use="start-date: 2013-10-23"
           xlink:href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">...</license>
</permissions>
```


## Media types and format

The PMC Tagging Guidelines should be changed to require the media types to be in
the @mimetype attribute only, and deprecate @mime-subtype.  The Style Checker should
verify that the @mimetype attribute is present, that it has a valid form, and that
@mime-subtype is not given.

PMC could develop a media type checking utility, using the same libmagic Unix library and data
files, to be applied to data and media files that accompany articles
for ingest.  The system could fix the @mimetype attributes in the source XML
to reflect the actual media types as determined by this library.  As mentioned above,
PMC has fixed the HTTP "content-type" headers, but if someone were to download the
article and accompanying media files, and share them outside of the PMC system,
the mismatch in the source XML could still be a problem.

Perhaps this utility could also function to validate the multimedia and other data files that 
are received.  Since these files form an integral part of the scientific record, just as
with the source XML, the validity of these files is important.
Since the operation of the OAMI began, we have found on the order of 100 video files which
could not be processed, because some essential information (for example, the frame rate, or intermediate I-frames) 
is not given, or not in a proper way 
([example](http://www.plosone.org/annotation/listThread.action?root=65463)).

Such a data validation system could start with a small set of 
file types, for which consistency checks could be set up.  The consistency checker could
be made available as a web service, and the Tagging Guidelines could recommend (but not require)
that files be provided in those formats, and link to the web service.

As mentioned above, [NISO 
RP-15-2013](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/10055/RP-15-2013_Supplemental_Materials.pdf) 
has recently been published, and we encourage publishers to adopt these
recommendations.  We note that there is another paper within these conference proceedings,
"[Extending JATS to include the NISO/NFAIS Recommended Practices for Online Supplemental 
Journal Article Materials](http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/jats-con/2013/schedule2013a.html#2-900)", which might prove useful in this regard.

However, we would also like to note that we have concerns about these recommendations, that
mirror some of the concerns that we have expressed about JATS in general.  Specifically, we 
feel that the recommendations are, in many cases, not conducive to producing consistent,
robust, and machine readable metadata.  

For example, in the description of the 
[\<license>](http://supplemental.niso.org/tag-library/index.html?elem=license) element,
they say, "The \<ext-link> can be used to link to licenses that are already defined, such 
as a Creative Commons license."  This should not be discretionary.  The specification
should be explicit that when a URI exists that identifies a license, that it must be
included, and in a well-defined place.  Note that this schema allows multiple
\<ext-link> elements under \<license>, so the ambiguities that exist in JATS, that 
have led to such wide variation in tagging of this metadata, are continued in this
new recommendation.


## Keywords

As mentioned above, we support the suggestion on the [NISO JATS document
page](http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/view_comment.php?comment_id=252) requesting
that the \<kwd-group> element be added to the content model of several new elements, 
including \<media> and \<supplementary-material>.


## Public versioning of PMC/OA XML files

Many of the issues discussed here could in principle be fixed by running some 
dedicated scripts over the affected XML files. However, even if such scripts 
were functional and readily available, there is currently no mechanism that 
would allow such fixes to be fed back systematically and automatically to the 
respective sources of these XML files, or to third-party copies thereof. One 
step in this direction would be to make the XML files available in an updatable 
environment with public versioning. This would be possible for articles in the 
Open Access Subset. Indeed, [eLife](https://github.com/elifesciences/elife-xml) 
and [Pensoft](https://github.com/pensoft) have demoed this on GitHub, and a tool 
for [porting JATS XML to MediaWiki 
environments](https://github.com/konrad/JATS-to-Mediawiki) exists as well.

Various kinds of modifications to existing XML are theoretically plausible that 
would merit adoption of such a system. These include &ndash; but are not limited 
to &ndash; typos, corrigenda and retractions, but also license changes (e.g. 
when copyright owner changes licensing backwards, or when copyright expires), 
media type mismatches, missing or mixed up files, captions or unique 
identifiers, or "in press" references.


## Use cases

So far, JATS has mainly been used to exchange information between publishers and 
archives. Under traditional notions of copyright, large-scale reuse of such 
information by third parties is very limited but PMC's Open Access Subset 
&ndash; particularly the Wikimedia-compatibly licensed portions thereof &ndash; 
opens the door for experimentation on this front. We see value here in 
introducing the concept of use cases and collaborating with suitable use case 
partners in further developing JATS as well as the corresponding guidelines and 
style checkers. The OAMI bot could serve as one such use case. [Species 
disambiguation](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-85), [citation
